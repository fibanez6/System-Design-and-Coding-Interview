== What is Object-Oriented Programming?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

== Key Concepts of OOP

=== Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference and misuse.

=== Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behavior (methods) from another class. This promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between the parent and child classes.

=== Polymorphism

Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It is typically achieved through method overriding and interfaces.

=== Abstraction

Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.

=== Coupling and Cohesion

- Coupling refers to the degree of direct knowledge that one class has of another. Low coupling is often desired.
- Cohesion refers to how closely related and focused the responsibilities of a single module are. High cohesion is often desired.

== Example in Python

[source,python]
----
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

animals = [Dog(), Cat()]
for animal in animals:
    print(animal.speak())

== Benefits of OOP

- Modularity
- Code reuse
- Scalability
- Maintainability
