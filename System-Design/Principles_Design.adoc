== SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are five design guidelines for writing maintainable and scalable software:

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change.
- **O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.

== DRY Principle

Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) encourages reducing duplication in code, promoting reuse and maintainability.

== KISS Principle

Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS) advocates for simplicity in design and implementation, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

== YAGNI Principle

You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI) suggests not implementing features until they are actually required.

== Separation of Concerns

Divide a system into distinct sections, each addressing a separate concern, to improve modularity and maintainability.
